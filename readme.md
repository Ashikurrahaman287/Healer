# Healer - Quran Mood Bot

**Healer** is a Telegram bot that provides users with Quranic verses (Ayahs) based on their current mood. The bot can respond with verses related to themes such as patience, happiness, and more. This bot is built using Go (Golang) and is designed to be deployed in a Docker container.

## Features
- Responds with Quranic verses related to different themes (e.g., patience, happiness, etc.)
- Can be integrated into a Telegram group or channel
- Built using Go (Golang) and Docker for easy deployment

## Requirements
- Docker
- Go 1.22 or later (for development)
- A Telegram Bot Token (from [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather))

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) on your machine.
2. Obtain a [Telegram Bot Token](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather) by creating a new bot with BotFather on Telegram.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/healer.git
cd healer
```

2. Set up your Telegram Bot Token by replacing the placeholder in the code with your actual token in the appropriate Go file.

3. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t healer .
```

4. Run the Docker container:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 healer
```

5. Your bot should now be running and listening for requests.

### Configuration

- Update the `config.go` file with any configurations required (such as your Telegram Bot Token and other environment variables).

### Usage

Once the bot is running, users can interact with it on Telegram. You can set it up in a group or allow users to message the bot directly. The bot responds with verses from the Quran based on specific moods like "Patience" or "Happiness."

Example commands:
- `/happy` - Sends a verse related to happiness
- `/patience` - Sends a verse related to patience

### Docker Setup

This project uses Docker for containerization. The Dockerfile contains all necessary instructions to build the container and run the bot in an isolated environment.

1. **Build the Docker image**:
```bash
docker build -t healer .
```

2. **Run the Docker container**:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 healer
```

### Deployment

You can deploy this bot to a cloud provider, such as AWS, DigitalOcean, or any other platform that supports Docker.
